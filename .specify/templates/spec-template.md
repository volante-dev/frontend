# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`

**Created**: [DATE]

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does the system handle [error scenario]?
- What differs between the French default route and the `/en` route?
- How does the behavior change when `COMING_SOON=true`, preview mode is active,
  or required content is missing?
- How does the experience behave with `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]
- **FR-006**: Public-facing copy, navigation, and metadata MUST support French
  and English, or document why the feature is private/non-public.
- **FR-007**: Public pages MUST define canonical/alternate metadata, Open Graph
  behavior, robots/indexing expectations, and JSON-LD impact where applicable.
- **FR-008**: User-facing interactions MUST define accessibility and
  reduced-motion expectations.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-009**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Content, Locale, and SEO Impact *(mandatory for public-facing features)*

- **Locales**: [French and English copy/routes affected, or N/A with reason]
- **Metadata**: [canonical, alternate, title, description, Open Graph, Twitter, robots impact]
- **Structured Data**: [JSON-LD/breadcrumb/organization impact, or N/A]
- **Indexing**: [sitemap, robots, noindex, IndexNow, coming-soon behavior]
- **Content Trust**: [source of public claims, portfolio facts, testimonials, or contact details]

### Operational Impact *(include if feature touches data, env, or launch behavior)*

- **Environment Variables**: [new/changed env vars, or N/A]
- **Database/Migrations**: [Prisma schema/migration impact, or N/A]
- **External Services**: [Resend, Edge Config, Vercel Analytics/Speed Insights, IndexNow, or N/A]
- **Launch/Runbook Updates**: [docs/SEO-LAUNCH.md or other operational docs to update, or N/A]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]

## Assumptions

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right assumptions based on reasonable defaults
  chosen when the feature description did not specify certain details.
-->

- [Assumption about target users, e.g., "Users have stable internet connectivity"]
- [Assumption about scope boundaries, e.g., "Mobile support is out of scope for v1"]
- [Assumption about data/environment, e.g., "Existing authentication system will be reused"]
- [Dependency on existing system/service, e.g., "Requires access to the existing user profile API"]
